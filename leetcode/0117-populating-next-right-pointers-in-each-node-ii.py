#### Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II (medium)
################################################################

# Given a binary tree

# struct Node {
#   int val;
#   Node *left;
#   Node *right;
#   Node *next;
# }

# Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no
# next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.

# Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL.

# Example 1:
#          1                  1-->NULL     
#      2       3          2------>3-->NULL  
#    4   5       7      4-->5------>7-->NULL
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
# Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]
# Explanation: Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should
# populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in
# Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next
# pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

# Example 2:
# Input: root = []
# Output: []
 
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 6000].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 
# Follow-up:
# You may only use constant extra space.
# The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not
# count as extra space for this problem.

## LeetCode Solutions

## Approach 1: Level Order Traversal
########################################
# Time: O(N) - Since we process each node exactly once. Note that processing a
#              node in this context means popping the node from the queue and
#              then establishing the next pointers.
# Space: O(N) - This is a perfect binary tree which means the last level
#               contains N/2 nodes. The space complexity for breadth first
#               traversal is the maximum space occupied and the space occupied
#               by the queue is dependent upon the maximum number of nodes in
#               particular level. So, in this case, the space complexity would
#               be O(N).
class Solution:
    def connect(self, root: Optional['Node']) -> Optional['Node']:
        
        if not root:
            return root
        
        # Initialize a queue data structure which contains
        # just the root of the tree
        Q = collections.deque([root])
        
        # Outer while loop which iterates over 
        # each level
        while Q:
            
            # Note the size of the queue
            size = len(Q)
            
            # Iterate over all the nodes on the current level
            for i in range(size):

                node = Q.popleft()
                
                # This check is important. We don't want to
                # establish any wrong connections. The queue will
                # contain nodes from 2 levels at most at any
                # point in time. This check ensures we only 
                # don't establish next pointers beyond the end
                # of a level
                if i < size - 1:
                    node.next = Q[0]
                
                # Add the children, if any, to the back of
                # the queue
                if node.left:
                    Q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    Q.append(node.right)

        return root


## Approach 2: Using previously established next pointers
#############################################################
# Time: O(N) - Since we process each node exactly once.
# Space: O(1) - Since we don't make use of any additional data structure for
