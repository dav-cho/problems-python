#### Binary Search Tree Iterator (medium)
#############################################

# Implement the BSTIterator class that represents an iterator over the
# in-order traversal of a binary search tree (BST):

# - BSTIterator(TreeNode root) Initializes an object of the BSTIterator class.
#   The root of the BST is given as part of the constructor. The pointer should
#   be initialized to a non-existent number smaller than any element in the BST.
# - boolean hasNext() Returns true if there exists a number in the traversal to
#   the right of the pointer, otherwise returns false.
# - int next() Moves the pointer to the right, then returns the number at the
#   pointer.

# Notice that by initializing the pointer to a non-existent smallest number,
# the first call to next() will return the smallest element in the BST.

# You may assume that next() calls will always be valid. That is, there will be
# at least a next number in the in-order traversal when next() is called.

# Example 1:
#       1
#    3     15
#         9  20
# Input
# ["BSTIterator", "next", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext", "next", "hasNext"]
# [[[7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []]
# Output
# [null, 3, 7, true, 9, true, 15, true, 20, false]
# Explanation
# BSTIterator bSTIterator = new BSTIterator([7, 3, 15, null, null, 9, 20]);
# bSTIterator.next();    // return 3
# bSTIterator.next();    // return 7
# bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
# bSTIterator.next();    // return 9
# bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
# bSTIterator.next();    // return 15
# bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return True
# bSTIterator.next();    // return 20
# bSTIterator.hasNext(); // return False
 
# Constraints:
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 105].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 106
# At most 105 calls will be made to hasNext, and next.
 
# Follow up:
# Could you implement next() and hasNext() to run in average O(1) time and
# use O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree?

# Your BSTIterator object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = BSTIterator(root)
# param_1 = obj.next()
# param_2 = obj.hasNext()

## LeetCode Solutions
#########################

## Approach 1: Flattening the BST
#####################################
# Time: O(N) - Is the time taken by the constructor for the iterator.
# - The problem statement only asks us to analyze the complexity of the two
#   functions, however, when implementing a class, it's important to also note
#   the time it takes to initialize a new object of the class and in this case
#   it would be linear in terms of the number of nodes in the BST. In addition
#   to the space occupied by the new array we initialized, the recursion stack
#   for the inorder traversal also occupies space but that is limited to O(h)
#   where h is the height of the tree.
#       - next() would take O(1)
#       - hasNext() would take O(1)

# Space: O(N) - Since we create a new array to contain all the nodes of the BST.
# - This doesn't comply with the requirement specified in the problem statement
#   that the maximum space complexity of either of the functions should be O(h)
#   where h is the height of the tree and for a well balanced BST, the height
#   is usually logN. So, we get great time complexities but we had to compromise
#   on the space. Note that the new array is used for both the function calls
#   and hence the space complexity for both the calls is O(N).
class BSTIterator:

    def __init__(self, root: TreeNode):

        # Array containing all the nodes in the sorted order
        self.nodes_sorted = []

        # Pointer to the next smallest element in the BST
        self.index = -1

        # Call to flatten the input binary search tree
        self._inorder(root)

    def _inorder(self, root):
        if not root:
            return
        self._inorder(root.left)
        self.nodes_sorted.append(root.val)
        self._inorder(root.right)

    def next(self) -> int:
        """
        @return the next smallest number
        """
        self.index += 1
        return self.nodes_sorted[self.index]

    def hasNext(self) -> bool:
        """
        @return whether we have a next smallest number
        """
        return self.index + 1 < len(self.nodes_sorted)


## Approach 2: Controlled Recursion
#######################################
# Time: 
# The time complexity for this approach is very interesting to analyze. Let's
# look at the complexities for both the functions in the class:
# - hasNext is the easier of the lot since all we do in this is to return true
#   if there are any elements left in the stack. Otherwise, we return false.
#   So clearly, this is an O(1) operation every time. Let's look at the more
#   complicated function now to see if we satisfy all the requirements in the
#   problem statement.
# - next involves two major operations. One is where we pop an element from the
#   stack which becomes the next smallest element to return. This is a O(1)
#   operation. However, we then make a call to our helper function
#   _inorder_left which iterates over a bunch of nodes. This is clearly a
#   linear time operation i.e. O(N) in the worst case. This is true.
#     - However, the important thing to note here is that we only make such a
#       call for nodes which have a right child. Otherwise, we simply return.
#       Also, even if we end up calling the helper function, it won't always
#       process N nodes. They will be much lesser. Only if we have a skewed
#       tree would there be N nodes for the root. But that is the only node
#       for which we would call the helper function.
# - Thus, the amortized (average) time complexity for this function would still
#   be O(1) which is what the question asks for. We don't need to have a
#   solution which gives constant time operations for every call. We need that
#   complexity on average and that is what we get.

# Space: O(N)
# - (N is the number of nodes in the tree), which is occupied by our custom
#   stack for simulating the inorder traversal. Again, we satisfy the space
#   requirements as well as specified in the problem statement.
class BSTIterator:

    def __init__(self, root: TreeNode):

        # Stack for the recursion simulation
        self.stack = []

        # Remember that the algorithm starts with a call to the helper function
        # with the root node as the input
        self._leftmost_inorder(root)

    def _leftmost_inorder(self, root):

        # For a given node, add all the elements in the leftmost branch of the tree
        # under it to the stack.
        while root:
            self.stack.append(root)
            root = root.left

    def next(self) -> int:
        """
        @return the next smallest number
        """

        # Node at the top of the stack is the next smallest element
        topmost_node = self.stack.pop()

        # Need to maintain the invariant. If the node has a right child, call the
        # helper function for the right child
        if topmost_node.right:
            self._leftmost_inorder(topmost_node.right)
        return topmost_node.val

    def hasNext(self) -> bool:
        """
        @return whether we have a next smallest number
        """
        return len(self.stack) > 0
